# Multithreading concurrency program simulating pet grooming
A multi-threaded program using the C pthread library.

Program designed to simulate a pet grooming facility that can accept dogs, cats, and other types of animals.
Dogs and cats cannot be groomed in the facility at the same time but other types of animals can be groomed as long as a station is open.

The goal is to simulate this environment while maintaining the separation between dogs and cats while preventing a type of animal being entirely locked out.
